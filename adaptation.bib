  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is the latest pigweed species documented in Connecticut; it was identified there in 2019. In a single-dose experiment, the Connecticut Palmer amaranth biotype survived the field-use rates of glyphosate (840 g ae ha−1) and imazaquin (137 g ai ha−1) herbicides applied separately. Additional experiments were conducted to (1) determine the level of resistance to glyphosate and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors in the Connecticut-resistant (CT-Res) biotype using whole-plant dose-response bioassays, and (2) evaluate the response of the CT-Res biotype to POST herbicides commonly used in Connecticut cropping systems. Based on the effective dose required for 90\% control (ED90), the CT-Res biotype was 10-fold resistant to glyphosate when compared with the Kansas-susceptible (KS-Sus) biotype. Furthermore, the CT-Res biotype was highly resistant to ALS-inhibitor herbicides; only 18\% control was achieved with 2,196 g ai ha−1 imazaquin. The CT-Res biotype was also cross-resistant to other ALS-inhibitor herbicides, including chlorimuron-ethyl (13.1 g ai ha−1), halosulfuron-methyl (70 g ai ha−1), and sulfometuron-methyl (392 g ai ha−1). The CT-Res Palmer amaranth was controlled 75\% to 100\% at 21 d after treatment (DAT) with POST applications of 2,4-D (386 g ae ha−1), carfentrazone-ethyl (34 g ai ha−1), clopyralid (280 g ae ha−1), dicamba (280 g ae ha−1), glufosinate (595 g ai ha−1), lactofen (220 g ai ha−1), oxyfluorfen (1,121g ai ha−1), and mesotrione (105 g ai ha−1) herbicides. Atrazine (2,240 g ai ha−1) controlled the CT-Res biotype only 52\%, suggesting the biotype is resistant to this herbicide as well. Here we report the first case of Palmer amaranth from Connecticut with multiple resistance to glyphosate and ALS inhibitors. Growers should proactively use all available weed control tactics, including the use of effective PRE and alternative POST herbicides (tested in this study), for effective control of the CT-Res biotype.},

  abstract = {Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth is a widespread issue in row-crop production in the Midsouthern US. Palmer amaranth is commonly found on roadside habitats in this region, but little is known on the degree of herbicide resistance in these populations. Herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations can represent the spread of an adaptive trait across a selective landscape. A large-scale survey was carried out in the Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas to document the level of resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, two important herbicides with broad history of use in the region. A total of 215 Palmer amaranth populations collected across 500 random survey sites were used in the evaluations. About 89 and 73\% of the surveyed populations showed {$>$}90\% survival to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, respectively. Further, only 3\% of the populations were completely susceptible to glyphosate, while none of the populations was completely controlled by pyrithiobac. Among the 215 populations evaluated, 209 populations showed multiple resistance to both pyrithiobac and glyphosate at varying degrees. Dose-response assays confirmed the presence of high levels of herbicide resistance in the five selected populations (≥ 25-fold compared to a susceptible standard). Results demonstrate the prevalence of multiple-herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations in this region. Growers should be vigilant of Palmer amaranth infestation in roadsides adjacent to their fields and implement appropriate control measures to prevent likely spread of herbicide resistance into their fields.},

  abstract = {Among dioecious flowering plants, females and males often differ in a range of morphological, physiological, and life-history traits. This is referred to as sexual dimorphism, and understanding why it occurs is a central question in evolutionary biology. Our review documents a range of sexually dimorphic traits in angiosperm species, discusses their ecological consequences, and details the genetic and evolutionary processes that drive divergence between female and male phenotypes. We consider why sexual dimorphism in plants is generally less well developed than in many animal groups, and also the importance of sexual and natural selection in contributing to differences between the sexes. Many sexually dimorphic characters, including both vegetative and flowering traits, are associated with differences in the costs of reproduction, which are usually greater in females, particularly in longer-lived species. These differences can influence the frequency and distribution of females and males across resource gradients and within heterogeneous environments, causing niche differences and the spatial segregation of the sexes. The interplay between sex-specific adaptation and the breakdown of between-sex genetic correlations allows for the independent evolution of female and male traits, and this is influenced in some species by the presence of sex chromosomes. We conclude by providing suggestions for future work on sexual dimorphism in plants, including investigations of the ecological and genetic basis of intraspecific variation, and genetic mapping and expression studies aimed at understanding the genetic architecture of sexually dimorphic trait variation.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is a troublesome weed in cotton production. Yield losses of                         65\% have been reported from season-long Palmer amaranth competition with                         cotton. To determine whether water is a factor in this system, experiments                         were conduced in 2011, 2012, and 2013 in Citra, FL, and in Tifton, GA. In                         2011, infrequent rainfall lead to drought stress. The presence of Palmer                         amaranth resulted in decreased soil relative water content up to 1 m in                         depth. Cotton stomatal conductance (g                         s) was reduced up to 1.8 m from a Palmer amaranth plant. In 2012                         and 2013 higher than average rainfall resulted in excess water throughout                         the growing season. In this situation, no differences were found in soil                         relative water content or cotton g                         s as a function of proximity to Palmer amaranth. A positive                         linear trend was found in cotton photosynthesis and yield; each parameter                         increased as distance from Palmer amaranth increased. Even in these                         well-watered conditions, daily water use of Palmer amaranth was considerably                         higher than that of cotton, at 1.2 and 0.49 g H20 cm−2                            d−1, respectively. Although Palmer amaranth removed more water                         from the soil profile, rainfall was adequate to replenish the profile in 2                         of the 3 yr of this study. However, yield loss due to Palmer amaranth was                         still observed despite no change in g                         s, indicating other factors, such as competition for light or                         response to neighboring plants during development, are driving yield                         loss.},

  abstract = {Premise of the Study Despite long-term research efforts, a comprehensive perspective on the ecological and functional properties determining plant weediness is still lacking. We investigated here key functional attributes of arable weeds compared to non-weed plants, at large spatial scale. Methods We used an intensive survey of plant communities in cultivated and non-cultivated habitats to define a pool of plants occurring in arable fields (weeds) and one of plants occurring only in open non-arable habitats (non-weeds) in France. We compared the two pools based on nine functional traits and three functional spaces (LHS, reproductive and resource requirement hypervolumes). Within the weed pool, we quantified the trait variation of weeds along a continuum of specialization to arable fields. Key Results Weeds were mostly therophytes and had higher specific leaf area, earlier and longer flowering, and higher affinity for nutrient-rich, sunny and dry environments compared to non-weeds, although functional spaces of weeds and non-weeds largely overlapped. When fidelity to arable fields increased, the spectrum of weed ecological strategies decreased as did the overlap with non-weeds, especially for the resource requirement hypervolume. Conclusions Arable weeds constitute a delimited pool defined by a trait syndrome providing tolerance to the ecological filters of arable fields (notably, regular soil disturbances and fertilization). The identification of such a syndrome is of great interest to predict the weedy potential of newly established alien plants. An important reservoir of plants may also become weeds after changes in agricultural practices, considering the large overlap between weeds and non-weeds.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth’s ability to evolve resistance to different herbicides has been studied extensively, but there is little information about how this weed species might be evolving other life-history traits that could potentially make it more aggressive and difficult to control. We characterized growth and morphological variation among 10 Palmer amaranth populations collected in Florida and Georgia from fields with different cropping histories, ranging from continuous short-statured crops (vegetables and peanut) to tall crops (corn and cotton) and from intensive herbicide use history to organic production. Palmer amaranth populations differed in multiple traits such as fresh and dry weight, days to flowering, plant height, and leaf and canopy shape. Differences between populations for these traits ranged from 36\% up to 87\%. Although glyphosate-resistant (GR) populations collected from cropping systems including GR crops exhibited higher values of the aforementioned variables than glyphosate-susceptible (GS) populations, variation in traits was not explained by glyphosate resistance or distance between populations. Cropping system components such as crop rotation and crop canopy structure better explained the differences among populations. The higher growth of GR populations compared with GS populations was likely the result of multiple selection forces present in the cropping systems in which they grow rather than a pleiotropic effect of the glyphosate resistance trait. Results suggest that Palmer amaranth can evolve life-history traits increasing its growth and reproduction potential in cropping systems, which explains its rapid spread throughout the United States. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need to consider the evolutionary consequences of crop rotation structure and the use of more competitive crops, which might promote the selection of more aggressive biotypes in weed species with high genetic variability.},

Despite extensive research on herbicide-resistance evolution, little research has been done exploring how Palmer amaranth might also be evolving other adaptive traits in response to different selection forces present in agricultural fields and the enrichment of soils with nutrients such as nitrogen. The objective of the present study was to determine whether Palmer amaranth populations have evolved different morphology and growth patterns in response to glyphosate use and fertilization history. Ten Palmer amaranth populations, including glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-susceptible (GS) populations, were collected from different cropping systems with histories of high and low nitrogen fertilization in the states of Florida and Georgia. All populations were grown in pots filled with soil fertilized with either 0 or 40 kgNha−1, and their response to nitrogen was compared for morphological, growth, and nutrient-use traits. Populations differed in how they modified their morphology and growth in response to N, with major differences in traits such as foliar area, branch production, leaf shape, and canopy architecture. Populations with high nitrogen-fertilization histories had higher ({$>$}43\%) nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) than populations with low nitrogen-fertilization histories. Similarly, GR populations have evolved higher NUE ({$>$}47\%) and changed canopy architecture more than GS populations in response to nitrogen fertilization. The results of the present study highlight the importance of paying more attention to adaptations to cultural practices that might increase weediness and how genetic changes in traits involved in morphology and metabolism might favor compensatory mechanisms increasing the fitness of the population carrying herbicide-resistant traits.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is an annual plant native to the desert Southwest of the United States and Mexico and has become invasive and caused large economic losses across much of the United States. In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970–2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011–2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of A. palmeri with climate change.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is the most problematic weed in agronomic crop production fields in the United States. A Palmer amaranth biotype was not controlled with sequential applications of glyphosate in glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean production field in south-central Nebraska. The seeds of the putative GR Palmer amaranth biotype were collected in the fall of 2015. The objectives of this study were to (1) confirm GR Palmer amaranth and determine the level of resistance in a whole-plant dose-response bioassay, (2) determine the copy number of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, and (3) evaluate the response of GR Palmer amaranth biotype to POST corn and soybean herbicides with different modes-of-action. Based on the effective dose required to control 90\% of plants (ED90), the putative GR Palmer amaranth biotype was 37- to 40-fold resistant to glyphosate depending on the glyphosate-susceptible (GS) used as a baseline population. EPSPS gene amplification was present in the GR Palmer amaranth biotype with up to 32 to 105 EPSPS copies compared to the known GS biotypes. Response of GR Palmer amaranth to POST corn and soybean herbicides suggest reduced sensitivity to atrazine, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)- (mesotrione, tembotrione, and topramezone), acetolactate synthase (ALS)- (halosulfuron-methyl), and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)- (carfentrazone and lactofen) inhibitors. GR Palmer amaranth was effectively controlled ({$>$}90\%) with glufosinate applied at 593 g ai ha−1 with ≥95\% reduction in biomass. More research is needed to determine whether this biotype exhibits multiple resistant to other group of herbicides and evaluate herbicide programs for effective management in corn and soybean.          ,                              Amaranthus palmeri es la malezas más problemática en campos de producción de cultivos agronómicos en los Estados Unidos. Un biotipo de A. palmeri no fue controlado con aplicaciones secuenciales de glyphosate en un campo de producción de soja resistente a glyphosate (GR) en el sur central de Nebraska. Las semillas del biotipo putativo GR de A. palmeri fueron colectadas en el otoño de 2015. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron (1) confirmar que A. palmeri es GR y determinar el nivel de resistencia en un bioensayo de respuesta a dosis con plantas completas, (2) determinar el número de copias del gen 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), el objetivo molecular de glyphosate, y (3) evaluar la respuesta del biotipo GR de A. palmeri a herbicidas POST para maíz y soja con diferentes modos de acción. Con base en la dosis efectiva requerida para controlar 90\% de las plantas (ED90), el biotipo putativo GR de A. palmeri fue 37 a 40 veces más resistente a glyphosate dependiendo de la población susceptible a glyphosate (GS) base utilizada. La amplificación del gen EPSPS estuvo presente en el biotipo GR de A. palmeri con 32 y hasta 105 copias más de EPSPS comparado con biotipos GS conocidos. La respuesta de A. palmeri GR a herbicidas POST para maíz y soja sugiere una sensibilidad reducida a atrazine, y a inhibidores de hydroxy phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) (mesotrione, tembotrione, y topramezone), de acetolactate synthase (ALS) (halosulfuron-methyl), y de protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) (carfentrazone y lactofen). A. palmeri GR fue efectivamente controlado ({$>$}90\%) con glufosinate aplicado a 593 g ai ha−1 con ≥95\% de reducción en la biomasa. Se necesita más investigación para determinar si este biotipo exhibe resistencia múltiple a herbicidas de otros grupos y para evaluar programas de herbicidas para su manejo efectivo en maíz y soja.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) is the most problematic weed in agronomic crop production fields in the United States. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of degree of water stress on the growth and fecundity of A. palmeri using soil moisture sensors under greenhouse conditions. Two A. palmeri biotypes collected from Nebraska were grown in loam soil maintained at 100\%, 75\%, 50\%, 25\%, and 12.5\% soil field capacity (FC) corresponding to no, light, moderate, high, and severe water stress levels, respectively. Water was regularly added to pots based on soil moisture levels detected by Watermark or Decagon 5TM sensors to maintain the desired water stress level. Amaranthus palmeri plants maintained at ≤25\% FC did not survive more than 35 d after transplanting. Amaranthus palmeri at 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% FC produced similar numbers of leaves (588 to 670 plant−1) based on model estimates; however, plants at 100\% FC achieved a maximum height of 178 cm compared with 124 and 88 cm at 75\% and 50\% FC, respectively. The growth index (1.1×105 to 1.4×105 cm3 plant−1) and total leaf area (571 to 693 cm2 plant−1) were also similar at 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% FC. Amaranthus palmeri produced similar root biomass (2.3 to 3 g plant−1) at 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% FC compared with 0.6 to 0.7 g plant−1 at 25\% and 12.5\% FC, respectively. Seed production was greatest (42,000 seeds plant−1) at 100\% FC compared with 75\% and 50\% FC (14,000 to 19,000 seeds plant−1); however, the cumulative seed germination was similar (38\% to 46\%) when mother plants were exposed to ≥50\% FC. The results of this study show that A. palmeri can survive ≥50\% FC continuous water stress conditions and can produce a significant number of seeds with no effect of on seed germination.},

Understanding weed emergence patterns is critical for developing effective IWM strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tillage timings and residual herbicides on cumulative emergence and emergence pattern of Palmer amaranth. Field experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 in a field naturally infested with photosystem (PS) II and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor-resistant Palmer amaranth near Shickley, Nebraska, in a bare ground study, with no crop planted in the plots, although residues from the preceding corn crop were present on the soil surface. Treatments consisted of shallow tillage timings (early, mid, and late), three premix corn or soybean residual herbicides, and a nontreated control. The Weibull function was fitted to cumulative Palmer amaranth emergence with day of year (DOY) and thermal time (TT) as independent variables. Year by treatment interaction was significant for time to 10\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 90\% Palmer amaranth emergence and cumulative emergence. The majority of Palmer amaranth seedlings emerged early, following early tillage with 90\% cumulative emergence occurring on DOY 172 compared with DOY 210 to 212 for mid- and late-tillage, and DOY 194 for the nontreated control in 2015. In 2016, 90\% of cumulative emergence following early-, mid-, and late-tillage (DOYs 201 to 211) were similar, and that of the nontreated control (DOY 188) was similar to that of early tillage. Nontreated control and PRE herbicide treatments had similar DOY values for 90\% emergence in both years. The number of emerged Palmer amaranth seedlings over the season was higher with shallow tillage than no tillage or with the use of PRE herbicides.},

Appropriate tactics for managing this weed proactively in the Upper Midwest will depend on characterizing its damage niche, the geographic range in which it can reduce crop yields. We implemented a common garden study in 2011 and 2012, planting eight accessions of Palmer amaranth from the southern and midwestern United States, into soybean crops in southern, central, and northern Illinois, at a population density of 8 plants m−2 with a biocontainment protocol. Once Palmer amaranth plants initiated flowering, they were removed and burned. Weed survival, flowering, and weed biomass were measured, in addition to soybean yield and weather data. Analyses indicated that Palmer amaranth's damage niche in Illinois soybean was independent of weed genotype or maternal environment. Despite competing only briefly, Palmer amaranth reduced soybean yields in all site–years, indicating its damage niche in Illinois, and much of the Midwest, is limited primarily by seed immigration rate. These results highlight the urgent need for weed managers to learn Palmer amaranth identification, prevent seed introduction, and maintain a policy of zero seed return.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Migratory waterfowl have often been implicated in the movement of troublesome agronomic and wetland weed species. However, minimal research has been conducted to investigate the dispersal of agronomically important weed species by waterfowl. The two objectives for this project were to determine what weed species are being consumed by ducks and snow geese, and to determine the recovery rate and viability of 13 agronomic weed species after passage through a duck's digestive system. RESULTS Seed recovered from digestive tracts of 526 ducks and geese harvested during a 2-year field study had 35 020 plants emerge. A greater variety of plant species emerged from ducks each year (47 and 31 species) compared to geese (11 and 3 species). Viable seed from 11 of 13 weed species fed to ducks in a controlled feeding study were recovered. Viability rate and gut retention times indicated potential dispersal up to 2900 km from the source depending on seed characteristics and variability in waterfowl dispersal distances. CONCLUSIONS Study results confirm that waterfowl are consuming seeds from a variety of agronomically important weed species, including Palmer amaranth, which can remain viable after passage through digestive tracts and have potential to be dispersed over long distances by waterfowl. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {A state-level survey was conducted across major row-crop production regions of Texas to document the level of sensitivity of Palmer amaranth to glyphosate, atrazine, pyrithiobac, tembotrione, fomesafen, and dicamba. Between 137 and 161 Palmer amaranth populations were evaluated for sensitivity to the labelled field rate (1X), and rated as resistant (≤49\% injury), less sensitive (50\% to 89\% injury), or susceptible (90\% to 100\% injury). For glyphosate, 62\%, 19\%, 13\%, and 13\% of the populations from the High Plains, Central Texas, Rio Grande Valley, and Lower Gulf Coast, respectively, were resistant. Resistance to atrazine was more common in Palmer amaranth populations from the High Plains than in other regions, with 16\% of the populations resistant and 22\% less sensitive. Approximately 90\% of the populations from the High Plains that exhibited resistance to atrazine POST also were resistant to atrazine PRE. Of the 160 populations tested for pyrithiobac, approximately 99\% were resistant or less sensitive, regardless of the region. No resistance was found to fomesafen, tembotrione, or dicamba. However, 22\% of the populations from the High Plains were less sensitive to 1X (93 g ai ha−1) tembotrione, but were killed at 2X, illustrating the background variability in sensitivity to this herbicide. For dicamba, three populations, all from the High Plains, exhibited less sensitivity at the 1X rate (controlled at the 2X rate; 1X = 560 g ae ha−1). One population exhibited multiple resistance to three herbicides with distinct sites of action (SOAs) involving acetolactate synthase, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, and photosystem II inhibitors. Palmer amaranth populations exhibited less sensitivity to approximately 15 combinations of herbicides involving up to five SOAs. Dose-response assays conducted on the populations most resistant to glyphosate, pyrithiobac, or atrazine indicated they were 30-, 32-, or 49-fold or more resistant to these herbicides, respectively, compared with a susceptible standard.},

  abstract = {Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of temperature on seed germination and growth of redroot pigweed, Palmer amaranth, and common waterhemp. At 15/10 C day and night temperature, respectively, no seed germination was observed in any species. Seed germination increased gradually as temperature increased. Germination peaked at 25/20 C in common waterhemp and at 35/30 C in redroot pigweed and Palmer amaranth. Seed germination of all three species declined when temperatures increased above 35/30 C. All three species produced less biomass at 15/10 C than at 25/20 C and 35/25 C. Redroot pigweed and common waterhemp biomass were similar at 15/10 C and higher than that of Palmer amaranth. However, Palmer amaranth produced more biomass than redroot pigweed and common waterhemp at 25/20 and 35/30 C. At 45/40 C, redroot pigweed, common waterhemp, and Palmer amaranth plants died 8, 9, and 25 d after initiation of heat treatment, respectively. The largest root volume among the three species was in Palmer amaranth grown at 35/30 C, whereas the smallest root volume was produced by Palmer amaranth grown at 15/10 C. Potential quantum efficiency (F                v/F                max) of Palmer amaranth was higher than that of redroot pigweed and common waterhemp at higher temperature. The greater growth of Palmer amaranth at higher temperatures may be attributed in part to its extensive root growth and greater thermostability of its photosynthetic apparatus.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous inference is a common problem in many areas of application. If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  abstract = {Experiments were conducted on Palmer amaranth seeds collected in 2004 and 2006 from a natural population near Pendleton, SC, to determine the temperature and light requirements for germination of seeds retrieved from soil surface or from 10-cm depth in the field. A cyclic change in seed germination of Palmer amaranth in response to temperature and light occurred during a 12-mo after-ripening period. Freshly matured seeds collected in November required mean temperatures ≥ 25 C, and natural or red (R) light for increased germination. Following after-ripening in winter, seeds experienced a reduction in dormancy and germinated higher at 25 to 35 C mean compared with 10 to 15 C mean. With after-ripening for an additional 3 mo in May, seeds experienced a broadening of thermal range (10 to 40 C mean), and germination in natural light or R light was more than twice the germination in the absence of light. Fluctuating temperatures (7.5 C amplitude) improved germination over constant temperatures, except in summer and fall (9 and 12 mo after seed maturation). Exposure of seeds to high temperatures during summer caused secondary dormancy induction. Averaged over thermal amplitudes, seeds retrieved in fall required mean temperatures {$>$} 25 C for increased germination. Burial in spring for 3 to 6 mo induced seed dormancy, and the relative germination in fall (12 mo after seed maturation) was at least 50\% higher for seeds retrieved from soil surface compared to seeds exhumed from 10-cm soil depth. Seeds retrieved in late summer and fall required natural light or R light for promoting germination, whereas far-red (FR) light or darkness inhibited germination. Furthermore, the effect of R and FR light was reversible, indicating a partially phytochrome-mediated germination response of Palmer amaranth seeds following 9 to 12 mo of after-ripening in the field.},

  abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) refers to the transfer of genetic information (alleles) from one plant to another compatible plant. With the evolution of herbicide-resistant (HR) weeds, PMGF plays an important role in the transfer of resistance alleles from HR to susceptible weeds; however, little attention is given to this topic. The objective of this work was to review reproductive biology, PMGF studies, and interspecific hybridization, as well as potential for herbicide resistance alleles to transfer in the economically important broadleaf weeds including common lambsquarters, giant ragweed, horseweed, kochia, Palmer amaranth, and waterhemp. The PMGF studies involving these species reveal that transfer of herbicide resistance alleles routinely occurs under field conditions and is influenced by several factors, such as reproductive biology, environment, and production practices. Interspecific hybridization studies within Amaranthus and Ambrosia spp. show that herbicide resistance allele transfer is possible between species of the same genus but at relatively low levels. The widespread occurrence of HR weed populations and high genetic diversity is at least partly due to PMGF, particularly in dioecious species such as Palmer amaranth and waterhemp compared with monoecious species such as common lambsquarters and horseweed. Prolific pollen production in giant ragweed contributes to PMGF. Kochia, a wind-pollinated species can efficiently disseminate herbicide resistance alleles via both PMGF and tumbleweed seed dispersal, resulting in widespread occurrence of multiple HR kochia populations. The findings from this review verify that intra- and interspecific gene flow can occur and, even at a low rate, could contribute to the rapid spread of herbicide resistance alleles. More research is needed to determine the role of PMGF in transferring multiple herbicide resistance alleles at the landscape level.},

Future climate scenarios indicate the potential for poleward range expansion. Herbicide-resistant weeds are increasingly becoming a major challenge for agricultural production worldwide. Palmer amaranth [Amaranthus palmeri (S.) Wats.] is an invasive annual forb that has recently emerged as one of the most widespread and severe agronomic weeds in the United States, due in part to its facility for evolving herbicide resistance. It has invaded several parts of the world, including key agricultural production regions in South America. Climate change will likely exacerbate the challenges of managing this species. To assess this, we developed a process-oriented bioclimatic niche model of Palmer amaranth to examine its potential global distribution under current conditions and future climate scenarios. The model agreed well with all credible current distribution data. Projected future increases in temperatures will expand potential Palmer amaranth range northward into portions of Canada and Europe. Model projections under current and future climates highlight several agricultural production regions of increasing and emerging risk from this weed.},

Greenhouse and laboratory experiments were conducted to: (1) confirm the presence of resistance to glyphosate, an ALS inhibitor (thifensulfuron), and atrazine in a single Palmer amaranth population; and (2) establish the molecular basis for resistance to these herbicide sites of action. In the greenhouse, glyphosate+thifensulfuron+atrazine at 1.26 kg ae ha−1+0.0044 kg ai ha−1+1.12 kg ai ha−1 provided 55\% control of the suspected multiply resistant (MR) Palmer amaranth population and 93\% control of the known susceptible population (S). The decreased sensitivity of the MR population compared with the S population at labeled use rates of these herbicides indicated that this population was likely resistant to three different herbicide site of action groups. The RF values for POST applications of glyphosate, thifensulfuron, and atrazine were 12.2, 42.9, and 9.3 times, respectively, for the MR Palmer amaranth population relative to the S population. The RF value for atrazine PRE for the MR population was 112.2 times. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the mechanisms for resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides and glyphosate in the MR Palmer amaranth population were target-site based, via amino acid substitution and amplified EPSPS copy number, respectively. There was a Pro to Leu substitution at site 197 in the ALS inhibitor–resistant plants, and there was a greater than 50-fold increase in EPSPS copy number in the glyphosate-resistant plants. There were no nucleotide changes in the psbA gene; therefore, atrazine resistance in this population was not target-site mediated. The evolution of this multiple herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth population poses significant management challenges to Michigan farmers.},

Female plants, for example, invested more in height, stem, and total dry weight, whereas male plants invested more in leaf area and leaf dry weight.

Initiation of flowering of female plants occurred 6 to 8 d earlier compared with male plants. Nitrogen and to a certain extent phosphorous were the most influential nutrients that affected measured parameters in both Palmer amaranth genders, particularly under high light intensity.

A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of Palmer amaranth density on seedling mortality, flowering initiation, and flowering progress throughout the growing season and biomass production and fecundity in wide-row soybean. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with three levels of Palmer amaranth density-clusters: high, medium, and low. Palmer amaranth mortality rate was greater at high Palmer amaranth population density-cluster, reaching a peak within 30 to 40 d after Palmer amaranth emergence (DAE) (0.55 and 0.80 for 2014 and 2015, respectively), in comparison with mortality rate at medium and lower density-clusters. Likewise, as Palmer amaranth density increased, biomass and seed production per unit area of the weed also increased. Biomass production at the high density-cluster in 2014 was 664.7 g m−2 compared with 542.9 and 422.1 g m−2 at medium and low density-clusters, respectively. Similarly, biomass production at high density-cluster in 2015 was 100.6 g m−2 compared with 37.3 and 34.2 at medium and low density-clusters, respectively. In addition, seeds produced at high density-cluster were 1.5 million and 245,400 seeds m−2 for 2014 and 2015, respectively. Seed production was reduced by 29\% and 54\% in 2014 and by 65\% and 75\% in 2015 at medium and low density-clusters, respectively. Earlier flowering initiation (i.e., between 30 to 40 DAE) occurred in higher Palmer amaranth density-clusters, indicating a trade-off between reproduction and survival at high densities and more stressed environments for species survival. Palmer amaranth male-to-female sex ratio was greater at high densities, 1.3 and 1.9, compared with lower densities of 0.6 to 0.7 and 0.7 to 0.8 in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The plasticity of Palmer amaranth population and population-structure regulation, vegetative growth, and flowering shifts at various levels of intraspecific competition (i.e., high vs. low population density-clusters) and the trade-off between these biological transitions merits further investigation.},

A field experiment was conducted in Fayetteville, AR, during 2014 and 2015 to examine the effects of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) establishment time in relation to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] emergence and the effects of A. palmeri distance from the soybean row on the weed’s height, biomass, seed production, and flowering time and on soybean yield. The establishment time factor, in weeks after crop emergence (WAE), was composed of six treatment levels (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 WAE), whereas the distance from the crop consisted of three treatment levels (0, 24, and 48 cm). Differences in A. palmeri biomass and seed production averaged across distance from the crop were found at 0 and 1 WAE in both years. Establishment time had a significant effect on A. palmeri seed production through greater biomass production and height increases at earlier dates. Amaranthus palmeri that was established with the crop (0 WAE) overtopped soybean at about 7 and 10 WAE in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Distance from the crop affected A. palmeri height, biomass, and seed production. The greater the distance from the crop, the higher A. palmeri height, biomass, and seed production at 0 and 1 WAE compared with other dates (i.e., 2, 4, 6, and 8 WAE). Amaranthus palmeri establishment time had a significant impact on soybean yield, but distance from the crop did not. The earlier A. palmeri interfered with soybean (0 and 1 WAE), the greater the crop yield reduction; after that period no significant yield reductions were recorded compared with the rest of the weed establishment times. Knowledge of A. palmeri response, especially at early stages of its life cycle, is important for designing efficient weed management strategies and cropping systems that can enhance crop competitiveness. Control of A. palmeri within the first week after crop emergence or reduced distance between crop and weed are important factors for an effective implementation of weed management measures against A. palmeri and reduced soybean yield losses due to weed interference.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of crop–weed interference effects on weed biology along with yield penalties can be used for the development of integrated weed management (IWM) tactics. Nevertheless, little is known about the beneficial effects of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] density, an important aspect of IWM, on late Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) establishment time. Two field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 to investigate how various soybean densities and A. palmeri establishment timings in weeks after crop emergence (WAE) affect height, biomass, and seed production of the weed but also crop yield in drill-seeded soybean. Soybean density had a significant impact on dry weight and seed production of A. palmeri that established within the first 2 wk of crop emergence, but not for establishment timings of the weed 4 wk and later in relation to crop emergence. Differential performance of A. palmeri gender was observed, regarding greater biomass production of female than male plants under crop presence, and merits further investigation. Grain yield reductions were recorded at earlier A. palmeri establishment timings (i.e., 0 and 1 WAE) compared with 8 WAE establishment timing in 2014 and 2015. High soybean densities resulted in greater soybean yields compared with low soybean density, but no grain yield benefits were observed between medium and high soybean densities. Crop budget analysis revealed the benefits of moderate seeding rate (i.e., 250, 000 seeds ha−1) increases in comparison to lower (i.e., 125,000 seeds ha−1) or high (i.e., 400,000 seeds ha−1) on crop revenue, net income returns, and breakeven price. Earlier A. palmeri establishment timings (i.e., 0, 1, and 2 WAE) resulted in lower crop revenue and net income returns compared with later establishment timings of the weed.},

Palmer amaranth populations in Brazil were very difficult to control using glyphosate, which resulted in many changes to standard weed management practices. A genotyping assay was used to confirm that the population detected in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, was correctly identified as Palmer amaranth and that it was not tall waterhemp. Greenhouse dose–response curves and shikimate accumulation assays showed that the Brazilian population was highly resistant to glyphosate, with an LD50 value (3,982 g glyphosate ha−1) more than twice the typical use rates and very little shikimate accumulation at 1 mM glyphosate concentrations in a leaf-disk assay. The Brazilian population was also resistant to sulfonylurea and imidazolinone acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor herbicides. The resistance mechanisms in the Brazilian population were identified as increased EPSPS gene copy number for glyphosate resistance (between 50- and 179-fold relative EPSPS gene copy number increase) and two different alleles for target-site mutations in the ALS gene (W574L and S653N). These results confirm the introduction of Palmer amaranth to Brazil using a genetic marker for species identification, as well as resistance to glyphosate and ALS inhibitors.},

It is thus a crucial event in the life of these plants, particularly so because of the peculiar relation of vegetative and reproductive development in seed plants which is in turn an outcome of the morphological nature of the flower. Flowers are modified shoots which are produced by modified shoot meristems, the flower primordia. However, once a meristem has been determined as a flower primordium, it is usually unable — except perhaps at the very earliest stages — of reverting to vegetative growth. Vegetative growth and reproductive development in seed plants are thus in a certain sense mutually exclusive; as far as a particular meristem is concerned, flower initiation means the end of its life. The central problem of the physiology of flower initiation is to understand which factors cause a shoot meristem to become a flower primordium, and how they consummate their action.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Herbicide-resistant weeds are a serious problem worldwide. Recently, two populations of Amaranthus palmeri with suspected cross-resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides (R1 and R2) were found by farmers in two locations in Argentina (Vicuña Mackenna and Totoras, respectively). We conducted studies to confirm and elucidate the mechanism of resistance. RESULTS We performed in vivo dose–response assays, and confirmed that both populations had strong resistance to chlorimuron-ethyl, diclosulam and imazethapyr when compared with a susceptible population (S). In vitro ALS activity inhibition tests only indicated considerable resistance to imazethapyr and chlorimuron-ethyl, indicating that other non-target mechanisms could be involved in diclosulam resistance. Subsequently, molecular analysis of als nucleotide sequences revealed three single base-pair mutations producing substitutions in amino acids previously associated with resistance to ALS inhibitors, A122, W574, and S653. CONCLUSION This is the first report of als resistance alleles in A. palmeri in Argentina. The data support the involvement of a target-site mechanism of resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Applied data analysts regularly need to make use of regression analysis to understand descriptive, predictive, and causal patterns in data. While many applications of ordinary least squares yield estimated regression coefficients that are readily interpretable as the predicted change in y due to a unit change in x, models that involve multiplicative interactions or other complex terms are subject to less clarity of interpretation. Generalized linear models that involve transformations of this linear predictor into binary, ordinal, count or other discrete outcomes lack such ready interpretation. As such, there has been much debate in the literature about how best to interpret these more complex models (e.g., what quantities of interest to extract? what types of graphical presentations to use?). This article proposes that marginal effects, specifically average marginal effects, provide a unified and intuitive way of describing relationships estimated with regression. To begin, I briefly discuss the challenges of interpreting complex models and review existing views on how to interpret such models, before describing average marginal effects and the somewhat challenging computational task of extracting this quantity of interest from regression results. I conclude with implications for statistical practice and for the design of statistical software.},

However, it was not known whether those differences were due to selection or other evolutionary processes. We used microsatellite markers to quantify genetic differentiation among 10 Amaranthus palmeri populations and determined whether the differences in life-history traits among the populations could be attributed to selection. Genetic differentiation was small (ΦST = 0.093), indicating that there were high rates of gene flow among populations. AMOVA showed that only 9\% of the genetic variability was explained by variation among populations and 90\% was found within populations. Using ΦST as a surrogate for FST in the QST−FST analysis, we confirmed that most traits followed the same pattern as neutral markers and were not under selection. However, important traits for weediness such as plant height, dry weight and nitrogen use efficiency were under selection. These results provide evidence that selection forces in agroecosystems can increase weediness in A. palmeri, and that those forces should be identified to develop strategies to counter them when possible.},

  abstract = {Sustainable strategies for managing weeds are critical to meeting agriculture’s potential to feed the world’s population while conserving the ecosystems and biodiversity on which we depend. The dominant paradigm of weed management in developed countries is currently founded on the two principal tools of herbicides and tillage to remove weeds. However, evidence of negative environmental impacts from both tools is growing, and herbicide resistance is increasingly prevalent. These challenges emerge from a lack of attention to how weeds interact with and are regulated by the agroecosystem as a whole. Novel technological tools proposed for weed control, such as new herbicides, gene editing, and seed destructors, do not address these systemic challenges and thus are unlikely to provide truly sustainable solutions. Combining multiple tools and techniques in an Integrated Weed Management strategy is a step forward, but many integrated strategies still remain overly reliant on too few tools. In contrast, advances in weed ecology are revealing a wealth of options to manage weeds at the agroecosystem level that, rather than aiming to eradicate weeds, act to regulate populations to limit their negative impacts while conserving diversity. Here, we review the current state of knowledge in weed ecology and identify how this can be translated into practical weed management. The major points are the following: (1) the diversity and type of crops, management actions and limiting resources can be manipulated to limit weed competitiveness while promoting weed diversity; (2) in contrast to technological tools, ecological approaches to weed management tend to be synergistic with other agroecosystem functions; and (3) there are many existing practices compatible with this approach that could be integrated into current systems, alongside new options to explore. Overall, this review demonstrates that integrating systems-level ecological thinking into agronomic decision-making offers the best route to achieving sustainable weed management.},

Prior to harvest, Palmer amaranth biomass was removed from the plots and quantified, Palmer amaranth seed production measured, and cotton yield determined. When Palmer amaranth plants were transplanted in 3- or 8-leaf cotton, cotton yield was reduced approximately 6\% for every Palmer amaranth per 6.1 m of row, with a maximum cotton yield loss of 60\%. In contrast, there was no effect of Palmer amaranth density on cotton yield when Palmer amaranth established at the 12- and 17-leaf stages of cotton. Maximum Palmer amaranth biomass, averaged over all densities, was achieved when Palmer amaranth was established at the 3- and 8-leaf stages of cotton (9,190 kg ha-1), while Palmer amaranth biomass from plants established at the 12- and 17-leaf stages of cotton was reduced 73\%. Palmer amaranth seed production per plant ranged from 61,000 when transplanted at the 3-leaf cotton stage to 14,000 seeds per plant for Palmer amaranth transplanted at the 17-leaf cotton stage. To avert cotton yield loss, Palmer amaranth interference should be eliminated prior to the 12-leaf stage of cotton; later-emerging plants may not affect cotton yields, but will replenish the soil seedbank.},

Field studies were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998 near Garden City, KS, to evaluate the effects of Palmer amaranth density and time of emergence on grain yield of irrigated corn and on seed production of Palmer amaranth. Palmer amaranth was established at densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 plants m−1 of corn row both concurrently at corn planting and when corn was at the three- to six-leaf stage. The control plots were weed free. The Palmer amaranth planted with corn emerged with corn, whereas that planted later emerged at the four-, six-, and seven-leaf stages of corn. The Palmer amaranth emerging with corn reduced yield from 11 to 91\% as density increased from 0.5 to 8 plants m−1 of row. In contrast, yield loss from Palmer amaranth emerging later than corn was observed only when the emergence occurred at the four- and six-leaf stages. The corn leaf area index (LAI) decreased as Palmer amaranth density increased. Reduction in corn LAI from Palmer amaranth interference was smaller for the second emergence date than for the first emergence date. Seed production per Palmer amaranth plant decreased with greater density, but seed per unit area increased from 140,000 to 514,000 seeds m−2 at densities of 0.5 and 8 plants m−1 of row, respectively, when Palmer amaranth emerged with corn and from 1,800 to 91,000 seeds m−2 at the same densities for later emergence dates. Although Palmer amaranth is highly competitive in corn, this study shows that yield loss is affected more by time of emergence than by density.},

  abstract = {The environmental conditions under which parental plants are reared can affect the seed characteristics of the progeny. The variation originating from such maternal effects has rarely been incorporated into models of seed germination. Here, using Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson), we examined the effects of water stress during the growth of parental plants on the progeny seed characteristics, including weight, size, final germination, and parameters of a hydrotime germination model. We grew two populations (from California and Kansas) under continuous water-deficit or well-watered conditions. In both A. palmeri populations, progeny seeds originating from water-stressed plants were heavier and larger than those from well-watered plants. Plants exposed to water stress also produced seeds that were \textasciitilde 30\% less dormant than seeds from control plants. To test whether the maternal environment affects the parameters of a hydrotime model, progeny seeds were subject to five water potentials (0, −0.2, −0.4, −0.6, and −0.8 MPa) and incubated at 20 and 30 C; germination was monitored daily. The estimated median base water potential (Ψb(50)), that is, the water potential at which 50\% of seeds cannot germinate, was consistently lower for seeds from water-stressed plants than for seeds from well-watered plants. Our results showed that A. palmeri plants experiencing drought during their growth produce seeds that are less dormant and can germinate from drier conditions—a maternal response that seems to be adaptive. These findings also call for development of germination models that incorporate the environmental conditions of both the current and past seasons to better describe the variability in germination of weed seeds.},

Use of herbicides and handweeding reduced Palmer amaranth seed populations 98\%, but 18 million/ha still remained after 6 yr. The use of herbicides and Palmer amaranth interference decreased the seed populations of common purslane by 84\%, but handweeding was inefficient. Yields of all but the first crop of cantalouple were almost totally eliminated by season-long interference of Palmer amaranth. Savings with the utilization of herbicides rather than handweeding ranged from \$62/ha for cotton to \$4703/ha for bell pepper.}

It causes high crop losses, and rapidly evolves resistance to herbicides. In Europe, A. palmeri was recorded mostly as a casual alien, but in 2018 it was reported infesting a soybean field in Italy, and the next year two more populations were found in the same area. Experiments were conducted on these three populations to evaluate the resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides, to determine the main resistance mechanisms involved and assess the efficacy of alternative herbicides with different sites of action than ALS. The three populations were confirmed cross-resistant to ALS-inhibiting herbicides (thifensulfuron-methyl and imazamox). Gene sequencing identified a Trp to Leu substitution at position 574 of ALS gene in resistant plants, proving that the main resistance mechanism for the three populations is target-site related. The presence of other resistance mechanisms cannot be excluded. Metobromuron, metribuzin and glyphosate are still effective on these populations.},

  abstract = {Waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) J. D. Sauer] and Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) are troublesome weeds of row-crop production in the United States. Their dioecious reproductive systems ensure outcrossing, facilitating rapid evolution and distribution of resistances to multiple herbicides. Little is known, however, about the genetic basis of dioecy in Amaranthus species. In this work, we use restriction site–associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) to investigate the genetic basis of sex determination in A. tuberculatus and A. palmeri. For each species, approximately 200 plants of each sex were sampled and used to create RAD-Seq libraries. The resulting libraries were separately bar-coded and then pooled for sequencing with the Illumina platform, yielding millions of 64-bp reads. These reads were analyzed to identify sex-specific and sex-biased sequences. We identified 345 male-specific sequences from the A. palmeri data set and 2,754 male-specific sequences in A. tuberculatus. An unexpected 723 female-specific sequences were identified in a subset of the A. tuberculatus females; subsequent research, however, indicated female specificity of these markers was limited to the population from which they were identified. Primer sets designed to specifically amplify male-specific sequences were tested for accuracy on multiple, geographically distinct populations of A. tuberculatus and A. palmeri, as well as other Amaranthus species. Two primer sets for A. palmeri and four primer sets for A. tuberculatus were each able to distinguish between male and female plants with at least 95\% accuracy. In the near term, sex-specific markers will be useful to the A. tuberculatus and A. palmeri research communities (e.g., to predict sex for crossing experiments). In the long-term, this research will provide the foundational tools for detailed investigations into the molecular biology and evolution of dioecy in weedy Amaranthus species.},

An understanding of the genetic basis of sex determination may lead to new methods of managing these troublesome weeds. Previous research identified genomic sequences associated with maleness in each species. Male-specific sequences were used to identify genomic regions in both species that are believed to contain sex-determining genes, i.e. the male-specific Y (MSY) region. These regions were compared to understand if sex determination is controlled via the same physiological pathway and if dioecy evolved independently. A contiguously assembled candidate MSY region identified in Amaranthus palmeri is approximately 1.3 Mb with 121 predicted gene models. In Amaranthus tuberculatus, several contigs, with combined length of 4.6 Mb and with 147 gene models, were identified as belonging to the MSY region. Synteny was not detected between the two species’ candidate MSY regions but they shared two predicted genes. With lists of candidate genes for sex determination containing fewer than 200 in each species, future research can address whether sex determination is controlled via similar physiological pathways and whether dioecy has indeed evolved independently in these species.},

  abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) might play an important role in dispersing herbicide resistance alleles in dioecious weedy Amaranthus species. Field experiments in a concentric donor–receptor design were conducted to quantify two sets of PMGF studies, an interspecific (Amaranthus tuberculatus × Amaranthus palmeri) and an intraspecific (A. tuberculatus × A. tuberculatus). In both studies, PMGF was evaluated using a resistant A. tuberculatus phenotype with enhanced mesotrione detoxification via P450 enzymes as a source of resistance alleles. For interspecific hybridization, more than 104 000 putative hybrid seedlings were screened with three markers, one phenotypic and two molecular. The two molecular markers used, including 2-bp polymorphisms in the internal transcribed spacer region, distinguished A. palmeri, A. tuberculatus and their hybrids. Results showed that 0.1\% hybridization between A. tuberculatus × A. palmeri occurred under field research conditions. For intraspecific hybridization, 22 582 seedlings were screened to assess the frequency of gene flow. The frequency of gene flow (FGF) varied with distance, direction and year of the study. The farthest distance for 90\% reduction of FGF was at 69 m in 2015 however, after averaging across directions it was 13.1 and 26.1 m in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This study highlights the transfer of metabolism-based mesotrione resistance from A. tuberculatus to A. palmeri under field research conditions. The results presented here might aid in the rapid detection of A. palmeri among other Amaranthus species and show that PMFG could be expediting the increase of herbicide resistance in A. palmeri and A. tuberculatus across US crop production areas.},

  abstract = {Failure to control Palmer amaranth with glyphosate and protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO)-inhibitor herbicides was reported across southwestern Nebraska in 2017. The objectives of this study were to 1) confirm and 2) validate glyphosate and PPO-inhibitor (fomesafen and lactofen) resistance in 51 Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska using genotypic and whole-plant phenotypic assay correlations and cluster analysis, and 3) determine which agronomic practices might be influencing glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth accessions in that location. Based on genotypic assay, 88\% of 51 accessions contained at least one individual with amplification ({$>$}2 copies) of the 5-enolypyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, which confers glyphosate resistance; and/or a mutation in the PPX2 gene, either ΔG210 or R128G, which endows PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth. Cluster analysis and high correlation (0.83) between genotypic and phenotypic assays demonstrated that EPSPS gene amplification is the main glyphosate resistance mechanism in Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska. In contrast, there was poor association between genotypic and phenotypic responses for PPO-inhibitor resistance, which was attributed to segregation for PPO-inhibitor resistance within these accessions and/or the methodology that was adopted herein. Genotypic assays can expedite the process of confirming known glyphosate and PPO-inhibitor resistance mechanisms in Palmer amaranth from southwestern Nebraska and other locations. Phenotypic assays are also a robust method for confirming glyphosate resistance but not necessarily PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth. Moreover, random forest analysis of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth indicated that EPSPS gene amplification, county, and current and previous crops are the main factors influencing glyphosate resistance within that geographic area. Most glyphosate-susceptible Palmer amaranth accessions were found in a few counties in areas with high crop diversity. Results presented here confirm the spread of glyphosate resistance and PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska and demonstrate that less diverse cropping systems are an important driver of herbicide resistance evolution in Palmer amaranth.},

  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is common in dioecious plant species and is usually attributed to different cost of reproduction associated with male and female functions. Differences in growth and performance between male and female plants may be accentuated under stress, potentially leading to sex-ratio biases and affecting population growth. Environmental stress involves multiple factors that often occur simultaneously. Among different stress combinations that occur in field conditions, competition and herbivory and their interaction are key biotic factors that can affect plant growth and performance. Here, we conducted a glasshouse experiment in Cardiff, UK, using the cultivated spinach, Spinacia oleracea, as a model system to study sexual dimorphism in intra- and inter-specific competitive ability and in response to herbivory by a generalist herbivore Helix aspersa. We found stronger inter- than intra-specific competition: growth (above-ground biomass) and chlorophyll content of male and female plants was reduced when growing with Brassica oleracea, but not when growing with conspecifics. In the absence of herbivory, females growing with same-sex neighbour had greater root biomass than males; whilst herbivory reduced root biomass significantly only in females competing with same sex neighbours. Plant damage caused by herbivores was similar when growing with male or female conspecifics but greater when growing with B. oleracea. Finally, plant damage caused by herbivores did not differ between male and female plants; however, males increased their allocation to roots and reduced their chlorophyll content after damage. Our results showed that sexual dimorphism occurs in S. oleracea, despite being a worldwide crop, selectively bred for its edible leaves. In particular, our results suggest stronger same-sex competition for females and greater tolerance to herbivory in males than in females of S. oleracea..},

  abstract = {Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson is a competitive weed native to North America with many herbicide-resistant biotypes that have been spreading around the world. Due to its fast growth, farmers need to optimise control timing to reduce the risk of escapes. This study tracked A. palmeri emergence and phenology using days or growing degree days (GDD, Tbase = 15°C; thermal time or hydrothermal time). While A. palmeri has been observed emerging throughout the summer growing season, this study found that 90\% of total season A. palmeri emerged before July in the absence of a crop canopy. Using thermal time, emergence could be predicted in different locations and years: reaching 10\%, 50\% and 90\% at 77, 278 and 593 GDD from January 1, respectively. From the time of emergence, 10\% of A. palmeri were 10 cm tall after 148 GDD, showed first signs of inflorescence by 212 GDD, and open florets by 419 GDD. Also, 50\% of A. palmeri plants had reached the respective stages by 244, 394 and 796 GDD. Using the probability of A. palmeri to reach different phenological stages over time as a function of emergence prediction, critical control windows were determined based on thresholds for risk of escapes. Many tactics and times of action are important for managing this weed. Information about A. palmeri biology indicates these actions could be timed more effectively using weather data and predictive models.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage reduces the physical movement of soil to the minimum required for crop establishment and production. When consistently practiced as a soil and crop management system, it greatly reduces soil erosion and is recognized for the potential to improve soil quality and water conservation and plant available water. Adoption of conservation tillage increased dramatically with the advent of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops that permitted in-season, over-the-top use of glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl] glycine), a broad-spectrum herbicide with very low mammalian toxicity and minimal potential for off-site movement in soil or water. Glyphosate-resistant crops are currently grown on approximately 70 million ha (173 million ac) worldwide. The United States has the most hectares (45 million ha [99 million ac]) of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant cultivars and the greatest number of hectares (46 million ha [114 million ac]) in conservation tillage. The practice of conservation tillage is now threatened by the emergence and rapid spread of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri [S.] Wats.), one of several amaranths commonly called pigweeds. First identified in Georgia, it now has been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Another closely related dioecious amaranth, or pigweed, common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer), has also developed resistance to glyphosate in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri. Hundreds of thousands of conservation tillage hectares, some currently under USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation program contracts, are at risk of being converted to higher-intensity tillage systems due to the inability to control these glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus species in conservation tillage systems using traditional technologies. The decline of conservation tillage is inevitable without the development and rapid adoption of integrated, effective weed control strategies. Traditional and alternative weed control strategies, such as the utilization of crop and herbicide rotation and integration of high residue cereal cover crops, are necessary in order to sustain conservation tillage practices.},

  abstract = {Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson (Palmer amaranth) is a fast-growing, dioecious, highly competitive agricultural weed species, which is spreading across the US Midwest. Population sex ratios are an important consideration in the management of A. palmeri populations as this species has become resistant to several herbicide sites of action, and there is need to minimize seed production by female plants. Environmental conditions, particularly stressors, may influence sex ratios, and herbicides act as major stressors and evolutionary filters in agricultural fields. Amaranthus spp. have shown a tendency for rapid evolution of herbicide resistance, with the frequency of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)-inhibitor resistance increasing across the Midwestern US. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of two PPO-inhibiting herbicide treatments of either lactofen or fomesafen on four different Illinois populations (Cahokia, Collinsville, Rend Lake, and Massac). Plants raised from seed from the Massac population were tallest, and both males and females from this population also had the highest vegetative biomass. Female plants from the Collinsville population had more reproductive biomass than male plants. Control populations were male-biased (Cahokia, Collinsville), female-biased (Masaac), and 1:1 (Rend Lake). Lactofen shifted the male-biased populations to female-biased or 1:1 and the female-biased population to 1:1. Fomesafen-treated populations were male-biased or 1:1. This study suggests that PPO-inhibiting herbicide treatments may influence the growth and sex ratio of A. palmeri populations, which is an underlying factor in the rate of herbicide evolution in this species. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how external factors influence sex ratios may eventually provide an opportunity to reduce seed production in populations by shifting sex ratios towards a male bias.},

Residual pre-emergence (PRE) herbicide applied at planting is one of the recommendations for management of herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth; however, information is not available about the effect of residual herbicides on critical time of Palmer amaranth removal (CTPAR) to prevent an unacceptable yield loss in soybean. The objective of this study was to determine the CTPAR in soybean affected by residual PRE herbicides compared with the no PRE herbicide in southcentral Nebraska. Field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 in a grower's field infested with GR Palmer amaranth near Carleton, NE. The treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with PRE herbicides (no PRE herbicide, flumioxazin, and a premix of flumioxazin/metribuzin/pyroxasulfone) as the main plot and Palmer amaranth removal timings as subplot treatments (a weed-free control; a nontreated control; and Palmer amaranth removal timing at the V1, V3, V6, R2, and R5 soybean growth stages). In the absence of a PRE herbicide, the CTPAR at 5\% soybean yield loss occurred at V1 and V6 soybean growth stages, equivalent to 194 and 480 Celsius growing degrees days (GDDc) in 2018 and 2019, respectively. When flumioxazin was applied alone, the CTPAR was delayed until the V3 and V6 soybean growth stages, or 341 and 501 GDDc. When flumioxazin/metribuzin/pyroxasulfone premix was applied, the CTPAR was delayed until the V2 and R1 soybean growth stages, corresponding to 255 and 546 GDDc, in 2018 and 2019, respectively.},

  abstract = {The ten dioecious species of Amaranthus, all originally pioneer plants of naturally disturbed habitats, have behaved quite differently during increasing human disturbance of their native continent, North America. Those at home in coastal marshes, beaches, and dunes have remained static while those from river floodplains and desert washes have been expanding and diversifying as weeds in artificially opened habitats. Direct historical evidence, mainly from a hundred year record of herbarium collections, permits partial reconstruction of the geographic and genetic changes. The amount of geographic advance has been very unequal even along different borders of a single species. In some cases expansion was local and completed before the present century; elsewhere migration has extended across whole states and is still active. However, unlike the common weedy monoecious amaranths, even the weediest dioecious species have remained geographically cohesive. With geographic expansion, former limited overlap between species has greatly deepened and exceptional hybridization has become common. Apparent hybrids derive from a large number of species pairs, involving not only all the dioecious but also some monoecious species. Crosses between dioecious and monoecious species run into a blind alley of sterility but crosses among dioecious species have yielded fertile off-spring, in some cases so abundantly that the taxonomic distinctness of the parent species is threatened. Hybrid populations are almost invariably concentrated in the newer, artificial habitats, perhaps because of less rigorous selection in such places. In natural habitats the older types of populations have remained relatively immune to invasion and hybridization.}

  abstract = {Kochia control in continuous corn became increasingly difficult in experimental plots where isoxaflutole was used PRE for 8 yr. Studies were conducted to determine if poor kochia control resulted from an escape mechanism based on different germination rates or from a difference in sensitivity to isoxaflutole. Germination at constant temperatures showed that the kochia population in the experimental plot had greater seed dormancy compared with populations growing in adjacent fields. Germination at 25 C for seeds collected from the isoxaflutole-treated area was near 20\% after 20 d, whereas germination for the other populations was above 80\%. The optimal temperatures to release seed dormancy for seeds from the experimental plot were alternating 35/25 C day/night temperatures. The kochia biotype that predominated where isoxaflutole was applied PRE had elevated levels of seed dormancy and required higher alternating temperatures to release dormancy than untreated control kochia. These characteristics were unique and not found in populations never exposed to isoxaflutole. Chlorophyll content was measured to determine if differences in sensitivity to isoxaflutole existed among biotypes. Absorption at 660 nm by photosynthetic pigments was similar among the biotypes at increasing herbicide rates, indicating no differences in sensitivity to isoxaflutole among populations. Reduced kochia control in the experimental plot was due to delayed seed germination, which allowed isoxaflutole to degrade before seeds germinated. The rapid herbicide dissipation from soil can be attributed in part to coarse soils, soil moisture, and the low isoxaflutole rate.          ,              El control de Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad en maíz de siembra continua fue cada vez más difícil en parcelas experimentales donde isoxaflutole fue usado en pre emergencia por 8 años. Se llevaron al cabo estudios para determinar si el control deficiente de Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad. fue el resultado de un mecanismo de escape basado en diferentes periodos de germinación, ó a diferencias en la sensibilidad al isoxaflutole. La germinación a temperaturas constantes demostró que las semillas de la población de Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad provenientes de las parcelas experimentales presentaron un mayor grado de dormicion comparada con la población que se encontraban en campos adyacentes. La germinación a 25 C para semillas recolectadas del área tratada con isoxaflutole fue cerca del 20\% después de 20 días, mientras que la germinación de las otras poblaciones fue superior al 80\%. Las temperaturas óptimas para liberar la inactividad de las semillas de la parcela experimental fueron alternando temperaturas de 35/25 C diurnas/nocturnas. El biotipo de Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad que predominó donde se aplicó isoxaflutole en pre emergencia mostró elevados niveles de dormicion de semilla y alternar temperaturas más altas para liberar la dormicion, en comparación con el testigo no tratado de Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad. Estas características fueron únicas y no se observaron en poblaciones nunca expuestas al isoxaflutole. El contenido de clorofila fue medido para determinar si existian diferencias en la sensibilidad al isoxaflutole existían entre los biotipos. La absorción a 660 nm por pigmentos fotosintéticos fue similar entre biotipos al incremental la dosis, lo que sugiere que no existe diferencias en la sensibilidad al isoxaflutole entre poblaciones. La reduccion en el control de Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad en la parcela experimental se debió a la germinación tardía, la que permitió la degradacion del isoxaflutole antes que las semillas germinaran. La rápida disipación del herbicida en el suelo puede atribuirse en parte a la textura y contenido de humedad del suelo y a la baja dosis de isoxaflutole.},

  abstract = {We model the release of insects carrying an allele at multiple loci that shifts sex ratios in favor of males. We model two approaches to sex ratio alteration. In the first (denoted SD), meiotic segregation (or sperm fertility) is distorted in favor of gametes carrying the male-determining genetic element (e.g., Y-chromosome). It is assumed that any male carrying at least one copy of the SD allele produces only genotypically male offspring. In the second approach (denoted PM), the inserted allele alters sex ratio by causing genetically female individuals to become phenotypically male. It is assumed that any insect carrying at least one copy of the PM allele is phenotypically male. Both approaches reduce future population growth by reducing the number of phenotypic females. The models allow variation in the number of loci used in the release, the size of the release, and the negative fitness effect caused by insertion of each sex ratio altering allele. We show that such releases may be at least 2 orders of magnitude more effective than sterile male releases (SIT) in terms of numbers of surviving insects. For example, a single SD release with two released insects for every wild insect and a 5\% fitness cost per inserted allele could reduce the target population to 1/1000th of the no-release population size, whereas a similar-sized SIT release would only reduce the population to one-fifth of its original size. We also compare these two sex ratio alteration approaches to a female-killing (FK) system and the sterile male technique when there are repeated releases over a number of generations. In these comparisons, the SD approach is the most efficient with equivalent pest suppression achieved by release of ≈1 SD, 1.5–20 PM, 2–70 FK, and 16–3,000 SIT insects, depending on conditions. We also calculate the optimal number of SD and PM allele insertions to be used under various conditions, assuming that there is an additional genetic load incurred for each allelic insertion.},

  abstract = {Harvest weed seed control is an alternative non-chemical approach to weed management that targets escaped weed seeds at the time of crop harvest. Relatively little is known on how these methods will work on species in the US. Two of the most prominent weeds in soybean production in the midsouthern US are Palmer amaranth and barnyardgrass. Typically, when crop harvesting occurs the weed seed has already either shattered or is taken into the combine and may be redistributed in the soil seedbank. This causes further weed seed spread and may contribute to the addition of resistant seeds in the seedbank. There is little research on how much seed is retained on different weed species at or beyond harvest time. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the percentage of total Palmer amaranth and barnyardgrass seed production that was retained on the plant during delayed soybean harvest. Retained seed over time was similar between 2015 and 2016, but was significantly different between years for only Palmer amaranth. Seed retention did not differ between years for either weed species. Palmer amaranth and barnyardgrass retained 98 and 41\% of their seed at soybean maturity and 95 and 32\% of their seed one month after soybean maturity, respectively. Thus, this research indicates that if there are escaped Palmer amaranth plants and soybean is harvested in a timely manner, most seed will enter the combine and offer potential for capture or destruction of these seeds using harvest weed seed control tactics. While there would be some benefit to using HWSC for barnyardgrass, the utility of this practice on mitigating herbicide resistance would be less pronounced than that of Palmer amaranth because of the reduced seed retention or early seed shatter.},

Merr.] from crop physiological maturity to 4 wk after physiological maturity at multiple sites spread across 14 states in the southern, northern, and mid-Atlantic United States. Greater proportions of seeds were retained by weeds in southern latitudes and shatter rate increased at northern latitudes. Amaranthus spp. seed shatter was low (0\% to 2\%), whereas shatter varied widely in common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) (2\% to 90\%) over the weeks following soybean physiological maturity. Overall, the broadleaf species studied shattered less than 10\% of their seeds by soybean harvest. Our results suggest that some of the broadleaf species with greater seed retention rates in the weeks following soybean physiological maturity may be good candidates for HWSC.},

  abstract = {Two of the most problematic Amaranthus species in soybean production today are tall waterhemp and Palmer amaranth. This study determined the percentage of tall waterhemp and Palmer amaranth seed that was retained by the weed at soybean maturity to assess the likelihood of using at-harvest weed seed control tactics for soil seedbank management. Palmer amaranth plants were collected from fields in Arkansas, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska, and tall waterhemp plants were collected from fields in Nebraska, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Collected plants were assessed for at-harvest weed seed retention in 2013 and 2014. Within 1 wk of soybean maturity, Amaranthus plants were harvested and the loose soil and debris beneath the plants were swept into a pan with a hand broom to collect any shattered seed. Percent seed retention ranged from 95 to 100\% for all states both years, regardless of species. There was a strong correlation between weed biomass (g) and total seed production (no. plant−1) in that the larger the plant, the more seeds it produced. However, there was no correlation between percent seed retention and weed biomass, which indicates that regardless of plant size and likely time of emergence, seed retention is high at the time of crop maturity. Overall, this study demonstrated that there is great opportunity for Palmer amaranth and tall waterhemp seed capture or destruction at soybean harvest. It is likely that nearly all of the seeds produced for both Amaranthus species passes through the combine during harvest to be returned to the soil seedbank. Thus, there is continued need for research focused on developing and testing harvest weed seed control tactics that aim at reducing the soil seedbank and lowering risks for evolution of herbicide resistance.          ,              Dos de las especies de Amaranthus más problemáticas en la producción de soja, hoy en día, son Amaranthus tuberculatus y Amaranthus palmeri. Este estudio determinó el porcentaje de semilla de A. tuberculatus y A. palmeri que fue retenido por la maleza al momento de la madurez de la soja, para evaluar la probabilidad de usar tácticas para el control de semilla de malezas durante la cosecha para el manejo del banco de semillas. Plantas de A. palmeri fueron colectadas en campos en Arkansas, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, y Nebraska, y plantas de A. tuberculatus fueron colectadas en campos en Nebraska, Missouri, Wisconsin, e Illinois. Las plantas colectadas fueron evaluadas por su retención de semilla al momento de la cosecha en 2013 y 2014. A la semana de la madurez de la soja, las plantas de Amaranthus fueron cosechadas y el suelo suelto y los residuos vegetales debajo de las plantas fueron removidos con una escoba de mano y fueron depositados en un contenedor para colectar semilla que hubiera caído al suelo antes de la cosecha. El porcentaje de retención de semilla varió de 95 a 100\% en todos los estados y en ambos años, sin importar la especie. Hubo una correlación alta entre la biomasa de la maleza (g) y el total de semilla producida (no. planta−1), así entre más grande la planta, más semilla produjo. Sin embargo, no hubo una correlación entre el porcentaje de retención de semilla y la biomasa de la maleza, lo que indica que sin importar el tamaño de la planta y el momento de emergencia, la retención de la semilla es alta al momento de la madurez del cultivo. En general, este estudio demostró que existe una gran oportunidad para capturar o destruir la semilla de A. palmeri y A. tuberculatus durante la cosecha de la soja. Es probable que casi toda la semilla producida por ambas especies de Amaranthus pase por la cosechadora al momento de la cosecha y que sea retornada al banco de semillas del suelo. Por esta razón, existe una necesidad de investigación que se enfoque en el desarrollo y evaluación de tácticas de control de semillas de malezas durante la cosecha con el objetivo de reducir el banco de semillas del suelo y a su vez disminuir el riesgo de evolución de resistencia a herbicidas.},

  abstract = {A common tactic in public debates over science and technology is to dismissively label innovations as mere technological fixes. This tactic can be readily observed in the long debate over agricultural biotechnology. While these criticisms are often superficial rhetorical tactics, they point to deeper philosophical disagreements about the role of technology in society. Examining the technological fix criticism can clarify these underlying philosophical disagreements and the debate over biotechnology. The first part of this essay discusses the origins of the notion of a technological fix and distinguishes two types of technological fix criticisms, philosophical and practical. These distinctions are then applied to clarify and evaluate arguments for and against agricultural biotechnology. This analysis should clarify the debates over agricultural biotechnology and bring to light fundamental philosophical differences over the role of technology in agriculture.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is an extremely troublesome weed for soybean growers because of its aggressive growth, adaptability, prolific seed production, and widespread resistance to many herbicides. Studies were initiated to determine the effects of herbicide application at first female inflorescence on Palmer amaranth control, biomass, seed production, cumulative germination, and seed viability. Enlist (2,4-D–resistant) soybean and Xtend (dicamba-resistant) soybean were planted and various combinations of either 2,4-D or dicamba with and without glufosinate and/or glyphosate were applied at first visible female Palmer amaranth inflorescence. Mixtures of 2,4-D þ glufosinate and 2,4-D þ glufosinate þ glyphosate provided the greatest control at 4 wk after treatment in Enlist soybean. Similarly, in Xtend soybean, combinations of dicamba þ glufosinate and dicamba þ glufosinate þ glyphosate provided the greatest control. The greatest reductions in biomass were from combinations of auxin herbicides (2,4-D or dicamba) plus glufosinate with and without glyphosate. Seed production was reduced most by treatments containing at least one effective site of action: an auxin herbicide (2,4-D or dicamba) or glufosinate. In contrast to previous research, cumulative germination and seed viability were not affected by herbicide treatments. This research indicates the efficacy of auxin herbicides or glufosinate alone and in combination to reduce the seed production of Palmer amaranth when applied at first female inflorescence. More research is needed to evaluate the full potential for applications of these herbicides at flower initiation to mitigate the evolution of herbicide resistance.},

  abstract = {A greater understanding of the factors that regulate weed seed return to and                         persistence in the soil seedbank is needed for the management of                         difficult-to-control herbicide-resistant weeds. Studies were conducted in                         Tifton, GA to (1) evaluate whether glyphosate resistance, burial depth, and                         burial duration affect the longevity of Palmer amaranth seeds and (2)                         estimate the potential postdispersal herbivory of seeds. Palmer amaranth                         seeds from glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible populations were                         buried in nylon bags at four depths ranging from 1 to 40 cm for intervals                         ranging between 0 and 36 mo, after which the bags were exhumed and seeds                         evaluated for viability. There were no detectable differences in seed                         viability between glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible Palmer                         amaranth seeds, but there was a significant burial time by burial depth                         interaction. Palmer amaranth seed viability for each of the burial depths                         declined over time and was described by exponential decay regression models.                         Seed viability at the initiation of the study was ≥ 96\%; after 6 mo of                         burial, viability declined to 65 to 78\%. As burial depth increased, so did                         Palmer amaranth seed viability. By 36 mo, seed viability ranged from 9\%                         (1-cm depth) to 22\% (40-cm depth). To evaluate potential herbivory, seed                         traps with three levels of exclusion were constructed: (1) no exclusion, (2)                         rodent exclusion, and (3) rodent and large arthropod exclusion. Each seed                         trap contained 100 Palmer amaranth seeds and were deployed for 7 d at                         irregular intervals throughout the year, totaling 27 sample times. There                         were seasonal differences in seed recovery and differences among type of                         seed trap exclusion, but no interactions. Seed recovery was lower in the                         summer and early autumn and higher in the late winter and early spring,                         which may reflect the seasonal fluctuations in herbivore populations or the                         availability of other food sources. Seed recovery was greatest (44\%) from                         the most restrictive traps, which only allowed access by small arthropods,                         such as fire ants. Traps that excluded rodents, but allowed access by small                         and large arthropods, had 34\% seed recovery. In the nonexclusion traps, only                         25\% of seed were recovered, with evidence of rodent activity around these                         traps. Despite the physically small seed size, Palmer amaranth is targeted                         for removal from seed traps by seed herbivores, which could signify a                         reduction in the overall seed density. To be successful, Palmer amaranth                         management programs will need to reduce soil seedbank population densities.                         Future studies need to address factors that enhance the depletion of the                         soil seedbank and evaluate how these interact with other weed control                         practices.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) is a problematic weed encountered in U.S. cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production, with infestations spreading northward. This research investigated the influence of planting date (early, mid-, and late season) and population (AR, IN, MO, MS, NE, and TN) on A. palmeri growth and reproduction at two locations. All populations planted early or midseason at Throckmorton Purdue Agricultural Center (TPAC) and Arkansas Agriculture Research and Extension Center (AAREC) measured 196 and 141 cm or more, respectively. Amaranthus palmeri height did not exceed 168 and 134 cm when planted late season at TPAC and AAREC, respectively. Early season planted A. palmeri from NE grew to 50\% of maximum height 8 to 13 d earlier than all other populations under TPAC conditions. In addition, the NE population planted early, mid-, and late season achieved 50\% inflorescence emergence 5, 4, and 6 d earlier than all other populations, respectively. All populations established at TPAC produced fewer than 100,000 seeds plant−1. No population planted at TPAC and AAREC produced more than 740 and 1,520 g plant−1 of biomass at 17 and 19 wk after planting, respectively. Planting date influenced the distribution of male and female plants at TPAC, but not at AAREC. Amaranthus palmeri from IN and MS planted late season had male-to-female plant ratios of 1.3:1 and 1.7:1, respectively. Amaranthus palmeri introduced to TPAC from NE can produce up to 7,500 seeds plant−1 if emergence occurs in mid-July. An NE A. palmeri population exhibited biological characteristics allowing it to be highly competitive if introduced to TPAC due to a similar latitudinal range, but was least competitive when introduced to AAREC. Although A. palmeri originating from different locations can vary biologically, plants exhibited environmental plasticity and could complete their life cycle and contribute to spreading populations.},

Making this weed particularly problematic to manage is its demonstrated ability to evolve resistance to herbicides. Herbicides to which A. tuberculatus has evolved resistance are photosystem II inhibitors, acetolactate synthase inhibitors, protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors, and glyphosate. Many populations of A. tuberculatus contain more than one of these resistances, severely limiting the options for effective herbicide control. A survey of multiple-herbicide resistance in A. tuberculatus revealed that all populations resistant to glyphosate contained resistance to acetolactate synthase inhibitors, and 40\% contained resistance to protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors. The occurrences of multiple-herbicide resistances in A. tuberculatus illustrate the need for continued herbicide discovery efforts and/or the development of new strategies for weed management.},

  abstract = {Immunofluorescence microscopy and in situ hybridization were used to examine the expression of genes encoding C4 photosynthetic enzymes during early leaf development in the C4 dicotyledonous grain plant amaranth. During early developmental stages, the chloroplast-encoded large subunit and nuclear-encoded small subunit genes of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase) were expressed in both bundle sheath and mesophyll cells in a C3-type pattern. The RuBPCase proteins and mRNAs became specifically localized to bundle sheath cells in the characteristic C4-type pattern as the leaves continued to expand and develop. Changes in the localization of the RuBPCase proteins corresponded closely with changes in the localization of their mRNAs, indicating that the cell-specific expression of genes encoding RuBPCase is controlled, at least in part, at the level of transcript accumulation. Genes encoding pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase were expressed specifically in mesophyll cells at all developmental stages examined. Immunolocalization with antibodies raised against phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) showed that this enzyme is present only in leaf mesophyll cells, even though RNA sequences with homology to PEPCase gene sequences were present in both bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. These results suggest that the regulation of genes encoding PEPCase in amaranth is complex and could involve the differential expression of divergent PEPCase genes or possibly regulation at the post-transcriptional level.},

  abstract = {In little over 20 yr, Palmer amaranth has risen from relative obscurity to its current status as one of the most widespread, troublesome, and economically damaging agronomic weeds in the southeastern U.S. Numerous factors have enabled Palmer amaranth to become such a dominant and difficult-to-control weed, including its rapid growth rate, high fecundity, genetic diversity, ability to tolerate adverse conditions, and its facility for evolving herbicide resistance. It is both a serious threat to several U.S. cropping systems and a fascinating model weed.

  abstract = {Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth has become the most economically detrimental weed of cotton in the southeast United States. With the continual marginalization of potential herbicide tools, research has expanded to include alternative means of affecting future Palmer amaranth populations by altering safe sites and reducing inputs to the seedbank population. The influence of delayed Palmer amaranth establishment on seed production potential has not been investigated in the southeast United States. Studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of time of Palmer amaranth establishment on morphology, growth, and seed production. The experiment was a factorial, with five levels of Palmer amaranth transplanting (0 to 12 wk after cotton planting) and two levels of crop type (cotton and noncrop). In the absence of crop competition, the first cohort of Palmer amaranth produced 446,000 seeds per plant. This potential seed production was reduced 50\% when Palmer amaranth plants were established nearly 6 wk later. In contrast, the first Palmer amaranth cohort growing in competition with cotton produced 312,000 seeds, 30\% less than was produced in the absence of competition. Interference from cotton shifted time to 50\% seed production to nearly 4 wk earlier in the growing season, relative to plants without crop competition. Delayed establishment of Palmer amaranth simulates premature loss of herbicide efficacy and alters the competitive balance between cotton and Palmer amaranth. Although the planting time that resulted in 50\% reduction in Palmer amaranth plant height at the end of the season was not affected by the presence of cotton, 50\% reduction in plant width and biomass occurred within the first 3.8 wk of the growing season when growing with cotton, more than 4 wk earlier than Palmer amaranth growing without a crop. This suggests that early season weed control programs will have a large effect on Palmer amaranth potential growth and seed production, as well as crop yield. To implement soil seedbank reduction strategies effectively, information on mechanisms that regulate Palmer amaranth persistence in the soil seedbank is needed.},

  abstract = {Although the prolonged emergence pattern of common waterhemp is well known, its effect on flowering phenology and success is less well understood. The ecological significance of later common waterhemp cohorts could have been underestimated. Ecological knowledge of common waterhemp, such as reproductive phenology and success, would help us better understand the invasiveness of this weed and thus facilitate the development of more targeted control methods. Field studies were conducted at Ames, LA, to evaluate temporal variation in flowering phenology (e.g., date of flower initiation, number of flowering plants per day) and reproductive success (e.g., seed production) of natural common waterhemp cohorts. Later-emerging common waterhemp cohorts flowered quicker and had a relatively shorter flowering period than early cohorts. Common waterhemp cohorts showed very large variations for the duration of their vegetative phases, indicating different photoperiod sensitivity among cohorts. Furthermore, common waterhemp cohorts exhibited a pulsed flowering pattern, which was probably influenced by temporal distribution of rain events; up to seven distinct flowering pulses within 40 d were observed in 2009, and about eight flowering pulses scattered over a 60 d period were observed in 2010. Common waterhemp maintained high seed production throughout the growing season. Seed production for the entire cohort was influenced more by emergence timing, whereas individual plant fecundity was more affected by plant population densities. Common waterhemp demonstrates strong phenological plasticity by evolving a pulsed flowering pattern, which rendered it plastic enough to tailor flowering to variable environmental conditions thus facilitating effective pollination. Common waterhemp later cohorts have a strong seed production potential, which may be ecologically significant with regard to herbicide resistance evolution.}

  abstract = {In pursuit of the perfect supervised NLP classifier, razor thin margins and low-resource test sets can make modeling decisions difficult. Popular metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall are often insufficient as they fail to give a complete picture of the model's behavior. We present a probabilistic extension of Precision, Recall, and F1 score, which we refer to as confidence-Precision (cPrecision), confidence-Recall (cRecall), and confidence-F1 (cF1) respectively. The proposed metrics address some of the challenges faced when evaluating large-scale NLP systems, specifically when the model's confidence score assignments have an impact on the system's behavior. We describe four key benefits of our proposed metrics as compared to their threshold-based counterparts. Two of these benefits, which we refer to as robustness to missing values and sensitivity to model confidence score assignments are self-evident from the metrics' definitions; the remaining benefits, generalization, and functional consistency are demonstrated empirically.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth–a fast-growing, challenging to control noxious weed that significantly reduces crop yields—was first found in Minnesota in September 2016 in conservation plantings sown with Palmer amaranth contaminated seed mixes. Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) designated Palmer amaranth as a Prohibited Noxious Weed in 2015 and listed it as a Noxious Weed Seed in 2016 by emergency order. A genetic test to identify Palmer amaranth was simultaneously developed by multiple labs providing a tool to limit its spread as a contaminant in seed. Seed companies adopted genetic testing methods for labeling seed for sale reducing introductions via the seed pathway. Additionally, MDA determined that manure spread on crop fields from contaminated screenings fed to livestock resulted in new infestations. Limiting spread via these and other potential pathways was critical to successfully reducing the impact of Palmer amaranth. MDA, University of Minnesota (UMN) Extension, Conservation Corps Minnesota and Iowa (CCMI), farmers, and other partners are working to eradicate these infestations before they can spread. In 2016, 35 sites were sown with Palmer amaranth contaminated seed mixes. Palmer amaranth was found at eight (23\%) of these sites. Management with intensive scouting, torching, prescribed burning, and herbicide application was implemented in 2016 and 2017. By 2018, no Palmer amaranth was found at any of these sites. Similar success to newer infestations in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was achieved using the same methods. MDA recorded management activities and documented a comprehensive timeline of Palmer amaranth in Minnesota. This timeline provides a story of success and challenges in combating and eradicating Palmer amaranth.},
